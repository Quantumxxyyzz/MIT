    "The most powerful chatbots in the world all **hallucinate** and lack an up-to-date understanding of the real world. GPT-4, for example, cannot answer questions about recent world events, no matter how important they were.\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of chatbots is frozen in time. Their world exists as a static snapshot of the world as it was within their training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem is *retrieval augmentation*. The idea behind this is plug-in a chatbot to an external vector database where they can then access *accurate* and up-to-date and information. Helping us limit hallucinations and answer questions about the latest events. In this example we will see how to do that.\n",

    "To begin, we must install the prerequisite libraries that we will be using in this notebook."

He was also the Prime Minister of Italy from 1922 until 1943. He was the leader of the National Fascist Party.\\n\\nBiography\\n\\nEarly life\\nBenito Mussolini was named after Benito Juarez, a Mexican opponent of the political power of the Roman Catholic Church, by his anticlerical (a person who opposes the political interference of the Roman Catholic Church in secular affairs) father. Mussolini\\'s father was a blacksmith. Before being involved in politics, Mussolini was a newspaper editor (where he learned all his propaganda skills) and elementary school teacher.\\n\\nAt first, Mussolini was a socialist, but when he wanted Italy to join the First World War, he was thrown out of the socialist party. He \\'invented\\' a new ideology, Fascism, much out of Nationalist\\xa0and Conservative views.\\n\\nRise to power and becoming dictator\\nIn 1922, he took power by having a large group of men, \"Black Shirts,\" march on Rome and threaten to take over the government. King Vittorio Emanuele III gave in, allowed him to form a government, and made him prime minister. In the following five years, he gained power, and in 1927 created the OVRA, his personal secret police force. Using the agency to arrest, scare, or murder people against his regime, Mussolini was dictator\\xa0of Italy by the end of 1927. Only the King and his own Fascist party could challenge his power.', metadata={'chunk': 0.0, 'source': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito%20Mussolini', 'title': 'Benito Mussolini', 'wiki-id': '6754'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Fascism as practiced by Mussolini\\nMussolini\\'s form of Fascism, \"Italian Fascism\"- unlike Nazism, the racist ideology that Adolf Hitler followed- was different and less destructive than Hitler\\'s. Although a believer in the superiority of the Italian nation and national unity, Mussolini, unlike Hitler, is quoted \"Race? It is a feeling, not a reality. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today\".\\n\\nMussolini wanted Italy to become a new Roman Empire. In 1923, he attacked the island of Corfu, and in 1924, he occupied the city state of Fiume. In 1935, he attacked the African country Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia). His forces occupied it in 1936. Italy was thrown out of the League of Nations because of this aggression. In 1939, he occupied the country Albania. In 1936, Mussolini signed an alliance with Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Germany.\\n\\nFall from power and death\\nIn 1940, he sent Italy into the Second World War on the side of the Axis countries. Mussolini attacked Greece, but he failed to conquer it. In 1943, the Allies landed in Southern Italy. The Fascist party and King Vittorio Emanuel III deposed Mussolini and put him in jail, but he was set free by the Germans, who made him ruler of the Italian Social Republic puppet state which was in a small part of Central Italy. When the war was almost over, Mussolini tried to escape to Switzerland with his mistress, Clara Petacci, but they were both captured and shot by partisans. Mussolini\\'s dead body was hanged upside-down, together with his mistress and some of Mussolini\\'s helpers, on a pole at a gas station in the village of Millan, which is near the border  between Italy and Switzerland.', metadata={'chunk': 1.0, 'source': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito%20Mussolini', 'title': 'Benito Mussolini', 'wiki-id': '6754'}),\n",

The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep Catholic people from being active in politics. That was the year of Italian unification.\\n\\nItaly participated in World War I. It was an ally of Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Central Powers. Almost all of Italy\\'s fighting was on the Eastern border, near Austria. After the \"Caporetto defeat\", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers surrendered. Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.\\n\\nFascist Italy \\nIn 1922, a new Italian government started. It was ruled by Benito Mussolini, the leader of Fascism in Italy. He became head of government and dictator, calling himself \"Il Duce\" (which means \"leader\" in Italian). He became friends with German dictator Adolf Hitler. Germany, Japan, and Italy became the Axis Powers.
